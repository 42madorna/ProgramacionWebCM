# Calculatron

## _A project for the course 20/8661 IFCT092PO PROGRAMACIÓN WEB CON SOFTWARE LIBRE of Community of Madrid_

This project has some challenges to achieve:

-   Build a time converter.  
     This has to be done passing a value in seconds to PHP
    and then, return them as seconds, minutes, hours and days.
-   Calculate area and length of a circle  
     It is done by passing the circle radius to PHP and
    this returns the area and length values.
-   Calculate area and length of a triangle  
     This is the most complex challenge of this project.
    You have to pass to PHP the three sides of the triangle,
    calculate and return the area and length values.  
    Why do I say it was the most complex challenge?
    You have to keep in mind that not every triangle exists, so
    of course, validation has to be done to prevent any malfunction.
